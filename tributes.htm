                  <h3>Tributes</h3> 
                   <p class="tribute">Daddy, I recall in 2000 when I was leaving for the university and that was the first time, I was leaving your home. I was accompanied by my uncle Engr. Gideon Obasi. You accompanied us to the gate and shook my hands and looked into my eyes and said now you are a man. At that point, I didn’t understand what you meant but much later when I found myself in campus without you or mum around, I had to learn to be myself and stay true to the values I got from you. I realized your words and have ever appreciated you. 
                        In all my sojourn within and outside the country, I have been blessed by your examples. Whenever I met crossroads and difficulties, I have always remembered your examples in prayer. Whenever I found myself in a heated and provocative environment, your examples of peace always showed me the way out. Whenever I felt distraught about my inadequacies, your example of contentment encouraged me to hang on. 
                        I love you Dad more than words could ever express and cherish every moment I shared with you. Although distance was a barrier, we were never apart because we kept in touch in so many ways. It was a delight for my kids or my wife to often speak with you over the phone and play around you whenever they visited.
                        I had prayed earnestly to God to keep you longer, but it pleased God to call you home at this time and I cannot question God. I am consoled because the bible tells me that you are in a better place even though I cannot see your face. I know you’re smiling down at me. I am encouraged by Revelations 14: 13 “And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them” 
                        Adieu Daddy, you have labored and now its time to rest in perfect peace and comfort.
                        </p>
