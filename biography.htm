                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>Prince Felix Amaefule was enrolled at the Apostolic Church School in 1952 and in 1956 he
                            emerged tops in his Standard 6 exams obtaining his First School Living Certificate. He then
                            proceeded to Harris Commercial Secondary School Aba from 1958 to 1962 where he obtained His
                            Royal Society for Arts & Commerce Stage 2 (Intermediate) with Second Class in English
                            Language.
                        </p>
                        <p> After graduation from secondary school, Prince Felix had to seek for clerical jobs in order
                            to sustain his ambition for further studies and in 1964 the opportunity came when he secured
                            admission with the Gordon Allen College London England where he pursued Advanced Diploma in
                            Accounting & Book Keeping in 1966. The political situation and resulting 30 months civil war
                            in the country affected his desire to pursue further studies as the level of deprivation and
                            poverty mated on the people of his region influenced him to seek employment.</p>

                        <p>They say marriage brings two families together, but in this case, the families of Amaefule
                            Osuala and Obasi Iwuoha were already enjoying rich friendship as both fathers were good
                            friends. So, it was not difficult that in 1967/68 when young Felix Amaefule approached his
                            father that he wanted to get married, his father simply nudged young Felix towards the
                            direction of his friend’s daughter, the beautiful and graceful Comfort Ozichi Obasi,
                            considering her great qualities. They got married in 1968 and their marriage was blessed
                            with 6 Children; five females and one male.

                        </p>
                        <p>Prince Felix Amaefule, had experienced sad moments during his lifetime. In 2004, after 36
                            years of marriage, God called his wife home. Due to the bond that existed between them many
                            thought he would not survive. In 2013, He remarried but unfortunately the marriage lasted
                            only one year as the wife died after a brief illness. In 2016, Mr. Felix received the
                            shocking news of the death of His first daughter who died during her fifth child birth,
                            while her husband who was terminally ill later died after two weeks. It was devastating for
                            him to attend the funeral of his first daughter and her husband. However, His faith in God
                            and resilience kept him going as he adopted the four grand children left by his late
                            daughter. Until his death Mr. Felix Amaefule, kept his immediate family and extended family
                            in prayers and showed great fatherly example both to his Children and people around him.</p>

                        <h3>Career</h3>
                        <p>Prince Felix Amaefule started his working career in the mid 60s shortly after completing his
                            secondary education. This was in order to sustain his desire for save for further studies
                            and this opportunity came in 1964. By 1968 when Port Harcourt fell to federal forces during
                            the war, Mr. Felix fled to his hometown with only a briefcase containing a few clothes and
                            his certificates. Life was really tough for him and his wife as they were not prepared for
                            the kind of survival the impact of the war meted out on them.
                            Shortly after the war in 1970, Mr. Felix decided to go back to Port Harcourt and begin a new
                            Life. This was not easy as he could not find employment even with his qualifications as a
                            result of the discriminations and victimization post war. It was not until 1972 that the
                            discrimination eased that he was able to bring his wife over to Port Harcourt and by 1974 he
                            secured employment at the Nigeria Engineering Works (NEW) Limited Port Harcourt as an
                            Accounting Assistant, a position far less than his qualifications which he accepted anyway.
                            This was the beginning of his corporate life as he worked, got further on the job training
                            and rose in ranks until his retirement in 1998 as Assistant Manager Accounts Department
                            after 25 years of meritorious service. During his career he built great friendships with his
                            colleagues that lasted much later after retirement.
                            Mr. Felix had a brief stint with other employments such as Sudelettra, Daewoo Nigeria
                            Limited until his final retirement into private life after the death of his wife in 2004.

                            his wife Comfort Amaefule. Together they complemented each other. As a trader, she was
                            amiable and can easily relate with people, Prince Felix, as an accountant, was quieter and
                            more conservative. Nevertheless, he was jovial to his close friends and had a good sense of
                            humor.
                            He built rich friendships with neighbors and co-landlords and tenants in his neighbourhood.
                            His friendship with some brethren continued irrespective of distance. Notable was Bro Edet
                            Akpan who was a true friend to the end.
